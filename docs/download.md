Download
========

Binaries for Windows and macOS are available in the
[Github Releases](https://github.com/windowjs/windowjs/releases/latest) page.

{: .strings}
| [windowjs-windows-x64.zip](https://github.com/windowjs/windowjs/releases/latest/download/windowjs-windows-x64.zip) |
| [windowjs-macOS-x64.zip](https://github.com/windowjs/windowjs/releases/latest/download/windowjs-macOS-x64.zip) |

Window.js can be [built](/dev/build) from the [sources](/dev/checkout) for
Windows, macOS and Linux.


**macOS**

The current releases are not signed
([issue #31](https://github.com/windowjs/windowjs/issues/31)).

The first execution of `windowjs` might get blocked by macOS for this reason.
Click "OK" and then open the "Security" setting in the "System Preferences";
it will mention `windowjs` having been blocked, and there's a button to
"Open" the application.

Alternatively, the `windowjs` binary can be
[built](/dev/build) from the [sources](/dev/checkout).
