Canvas
======

The [window.canvas](/doc/window#window.canvas) object is the 2D canvas that
draws to the main window.

It implements the
[CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)
API from HTML5, and its
[documentation at MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)
applies to the Window.js implementation as well. The
[Canvas tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial)
gives an overview of the capabilities of the API.

The [window.canvas](/doc/window#window.canvas) object is always present in
Window.js, and renders directly to the main window. It's also possible to create
additional [CanvasRenderingContext2D](#CanvasRenderingContext2D) instances;
each instance has its own framebuffer and can be used to draw off the main
screen. The contents of an off-screen canvas can be drawn to the main canvas
via [drawImage](#canvas.drawImage).


{% include constructor class="CanvasRenderingContext2D" %}

Creates a new off-screen canvas. Its contents can be drawn to the main canvas
in [window.canvas](/doc/window#window.canvas) via
[drawImage](#canvas.drawImage).

{: .parameters}
| width  | number | The width of the offscreen canvas.                         |
| height | number | The height of the offscreen canvas.                        |


{% include property object="canvas" name="antialias" type="boolean" %}

{% include tag extension=true %}

Whether shapes drawn in this canvas should be antialiased. Defaults to true.


{% include property object="canvas" name="fillStyle"
   type="string | CanvasGradient"
%}

The style to apply in the fill operations ([fill](#canvas.fill),
[fillRect](#canvas.fillRect) and [fillText](#canvas.fillText)).

Valid values are [CanvasGradient](/doc/canvasgradient) instances, or strings
representing a CSS color in one of these formats:

*  `#rgb`
*  `#rgba`
*  `#rrggbb`
*  `#rrggbbaa`
*  `rgb(r, g, b)`
*  `rgba(r, g, b, a)`
*  A
[CSS color name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#color_keywords)
like `red` or `dodgerblue`.

See also
[fillStyle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillStyle)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="font" type="string" %}

The font to use in text operations ([fillText](#canvas.fillText),
[strokeText](#canvas.strokeText) and [measureText](#canvas.measureText)).

The list of fonts available in the current platform are listed in
[window.fonts](/doc/window#window.fonts).

Custom fonts can be loaded with [window.loadFont](/doc/window#window.loadFont).

Font names with spaces like "Segoe UI" must be wrapped in double quotes.

The font name can be optionally preceeded by `italic`, `bold` and the font
size as `Npx`. These are all valid font settings:

*  `monospace`
*  `bold 16px "Segoe UI"`

See also
[font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/font)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="globalAlpha" type="number" %}

Specifies the alpha (transparency) value that is applied to shapes and images
before they are drawn onto the canvas. The defaut value is `1.0`.

See also
[globalAlpha](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/globalAlpha)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="globalCompositeOperation"
   type="string"
%}

Sets the type of compositing operation to apply when drawing new shapes.
See the
[Compositing and clipping](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Compositing)
section of the
[Canvas tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial)
at MDN for a list of valid operations and their effect.

The following values are supported in Window.js:

*  `source-over`

at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="height" type="number" %}

{% include tag extension=true %}

The height of the canvas, in pixels.

**Note:** the size of the canvas is automatically adjusted when the window is
[resized](/doc/window#event-resize). If the main application supports
[resizing](/doc/window#window.resizable) then it should also listen for
["resize"](/doc/window#event-resize) events and draw a full frame after each
resize. Window.js will also invoke any pending
[requestAnimationFrame](/doc/global#requestAnimationFrame) callbacks when
the window is resized.


{% include property object="canvas" name="imageSmoothingEnabled"
   type="boolean"
%}

Determines whether scaled images are smoothed or not. The default is true.

Images can be drawn via the [drawImage](#canvas.drawImage) API, and the
destination size in the canvas may be different from the source size in the
[ImageBitmap](/doc/imagebitmap). In those cases, the image gets scaled up or
down. This setting controls whether the rescaled image should look smoother
(when it's turned on), or sharper (when it's turned off).

Disabling `imageSmoothingEnabled` draws images with a more blocky, pixelated
style.

See also
[imageSmoothingEnabled](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/imageSmoothingEnabled)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="imageSmoothingQuality"
   type="string"
%}

Controls the quality of the smoothing applied to scaled images when
[imageSmoothingEnabled](#canvas.imageSmoothingEnabled) is enabled.

Valid values are `"low"`, `"medium"` and `"high"`.

See also
[imageSmoothingQuality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/imageSmoothingQuality)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="lineCap" type="string" %}

The shape used to draw the end points of lines.

{: .strings}
| `"butt"`   | (Default value) The ends of lines are squared off at the endpoints. |
| `"round"`  | The ends of lines are rounded.                                  |
| `"square"` | The ends of lines are squared off by adding a box with an equal width and half the height of the line's thickness. |

See also
[lineCap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineCap)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="lineDashOffset" type="number" %}

The line dash offset. Defaults to 0.

See also
[lineDashOffset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineDashOffset)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="lineJoin" type="string" %}

The shape used to join two line segments where they meet.

{: .strings}
| `"bevel"` | Fills an additional triangular area between the common endpoint of connected segments, and the separate outside rectangular corners of each segment. |
| `"round"` | Rounds off the corners of a shape by filling an additional sector of disc centered at the common endpoint of connected segments. The radius for these rounded corners is equal to the line width. |
| `"miter"` | (Default value) Connected segments are joined by extending their outside edges to connect at a single point, with the effect of filling an additional lozenge-shaped area. This setting is affected by the [miterLimit](#canvas.miterLimit) property. |

See also
[lineJoin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/lineJoin)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="lineWidth" type="number" %}

non-transparent value. One of the [shadowBlur](#canvas.shadowBlur),
[shadowOffsetX](#canvas.shadowOffsetX) or [shadowOffsetY](#canvas.shadowOffsetY)
properties must be non-zero as well.

The CSS color must be in one of these formats:

*  `#rgb`

[textBaseline](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/textBaseline)
at MDN.


{% include property object="canvas" name="width" type="number" %}

{% include tag extension=true %}

The width of the canvas, in pixels.

**Note:** the size of the canvas is automatically adjusted when the window is
[resized](/doc/window#event-resize). If the main application supports
[resizing](/doc/window#window.resizable) then it should also listen for
["resize"](/doc/window#event-resize) events and draw a full frame after each

{% include method object="canvas" name="closePath" type="() => void" %}

Adds a straight line from the current point to the start of the current
sub-path. Does nothing if the shape has already been closed, or has only one
point.

This method doesn't draw anything to the canvas directly; the path can be
rendered via the [fill](#canvas.fill) and [stroke](#canvas.stroke) methods.

See also
[closePath](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/closePath)
at MDN.


{% include method object="canvas" name="clearRect"

The main window supports transparency but is initially set to opaque black.
It must be cleared and filled with a transparent overlay to enable transparency:

```javascript
const canvas = window.canvas;
canvas.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
canvas.fillStyle = '#000000b0';
canvas.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
```
